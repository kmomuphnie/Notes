Use the modulus to accomplish a loop: end to head with specific position

`char array[3];`       means ask for a block of memory space that can hold three characters, but to have A END , it must be given a `'\0'` even 
added manually.

enough buffer space and when do the strcpy make sure that the source strig must have `'\0'`.

...
AND the `char abc = "abc"; ` already give the `'\0'`  `'a','b','c','\0';` Because the  [ "" ] means giving a '\0' to the memory space u asked.
