1.Use the modulus to accomplish a end-start loop: end to head with specific position


2.`char array[3];`  means ask for a block of memory space that can hold three characters, but to have A END , it must be given a `'\0'` even added manually.

3.enough buffer space and when do the strcpy make sure that the source strig must have `'\0'`.

4.AND the `char abc = "abc"; ` already give the `'\0'`  `'a','b','c','\0';` Because the  `""`means giving a '\0' to the memory space u asked.
