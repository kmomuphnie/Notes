1. NULL in ASCII is \x00, so even HJ\x00\n appears the same as HJ\n, but they are not the same.
when go through a array use while loop ('\0'condition) is better than use for loop(find length first), since if we use for loop. it may reach out of the array
and cause some error.

2. MIND the Consecutive memory location, because when we declare a array, make sure we reserve space for the NULL to end the chunk the current
use of memory.

3.Do not overstep the bounds of the array or suffer the segmentation fault
